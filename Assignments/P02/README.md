## Program 2 - Graphviz Class

### Loic Konan

#### Description

This Program is about implementing a **graphviz Language "wrapper" or "facade"**.
This means we will be implementing a (tiny) **subset** of the graphviz language capability so we can visualize some of the typical data structures.

- **GraphViz** is a software library that takes a structured syntax and turns it into a visual representation of a "graph" (get it? "graph" "viz") :smile:.

- It allows a developer to visualize what may be happening with our data structures. Wouldn't you like to see your linked list printed as something more than just:

  - head->10->20->30->null 😏??
