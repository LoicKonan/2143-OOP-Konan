### Loic Konan

### Description

Re-writing the RgbColor class from this [code.cpp](code.cpp) using a **Vector** to hold all of the rgb colors so that it stores many colors and naming it **ColorPallette**.
Decided to implement Inheritance with the two main class in order to make sure that they are tightly couples.
