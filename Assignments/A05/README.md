## Definitions

#### Class

> In object-oriented programming, a Class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
> which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
> For example:

#### Object

> In object-oriented programming, an Object is an instance of a class. An object is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and  properties to make a particular type of data useful.
> For example:

#### Method

> A method is a programmed procedure that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class.
> A method in an object can only have access to the data known to that object, which ensures data integrity among the
> set of objects in an application. A method can be re-used in multiple objects.
> For example:

#### Abstraction

Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming mean to "shows" only essential attributes and "hides"
unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.

#### Attributes / Properties

> Attributes / Properties are data stored inside a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance
> In short, attributes / Properties store information about the instance.
> For example:

#### Class Variable

> A Class Variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses.It is also known as static variables declared
> with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
> For example:
