## Definitions

#### Class

> In object-oriented programming, a Class is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions,
> which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a blueprint for an object.
> For example:

> is an instance of a class. An object in OOPS is nothing but a self-contained component which consists of methods and 
> properties to make a particular type of data useful.
