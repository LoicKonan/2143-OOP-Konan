## Definitions

#### Class

> In object-oriented programming, a Class is a **user-defined data type**, which holds its own data members and member functions,
> which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A C++ class is like a ***blueprint for an object***.
>> For example:

#### Object

> In object-oriented programming, an Object is an **instance of a class**. An object is nothing but a self-contained component
> which consists of methods and  properties to make a particular type of data useful.
>> For example:
>

#### Method

> A method is a **programmed procedure** that is defined as part of a class and included in any object of that class.
> A method in an object can only have access to the data known to that object, which ensures data integrity among the
> set of objects in an application. A method can be ***re-used*** in multiple objects.
>> For example:

#### Abstraction

> Abstraction in Object-Oriented Programming mean to **"shows" only essential attributes and "hides"**
> unnecessary information. The main purpose of abstraction is hiding the unnecessary details from the users.
>> For example:

#### Attributes / Properties

> Attributes / Properties are **data stored inside** a class or instance and represent the state or quality of the class or instance.
> In short, attributes / Properties **store information about the instance**.
>> For example:
>
> ><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/700/1*MV6B2jANikTULx6wFLrcEg.png" width=450>

#### Class Variable

> A Class Variables are shared between a class and all its subclasses. It is also known as **static variables** declared
> with the ***static*** keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
>> For example:
>
> <img src="https://www.programmerinterview.com/images/memVariables.png" width=450>

#### Composition

> It enables creating complex types by combining objects of other types.
> This means that a class Composite can contain an object of another class Component.
> This relationship means that a Composite **has a** Component.
>> For example:
>
> <img src="https://image.slidesharecdn.com/compositionppt-170615151624/95/composition-in-oop-2-638.jpg?cb=1507486822" width=450>

#### Constructor

> Constructors have the **same name** as the class or struct, and they usually **initialize the data members of the new object**.
> In C++, Constructor is automatically called when object (instance of class) create.
>> For example:
> <img src="https://www.studytonight.com/cpp/images/copy-constructor.gif" width=450>

#### Encapsulation

> It refers to the bundling of data with the methods that operate on that data.
> **Encapsulation** is used to hide the values or state of a structured data object inside a class,
> preventing unauthorized partiesâ€™ direct access to them.
>> For example:
> <img src="http://www.expertphp.in/images/articles/ArtImgKPTPrr_OOP4.jpg" width=450>

#### Friends

> If a function is **friend function** of a class, then the friend function is not the actual member of the class.
> But that friend function ***has rights to access*** to all private and protected members (variables and functions).
>> For example:
> <img src="https://www.cpp.thiyagaraaj.com/cms/assets/cimages/friend_function.png" width=450>

#### Inheritance

> Is the ability of a class to **derive or inherit** methods and properties from another class.
>> For example:
> <img src="https://www.cpp.thiyagaraaj.com/cms/assets/cimages/friend_function.png" width=450>
